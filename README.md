# Query Answering In Knowledge Space

This Code is the implementation of "Optimized Query Answering in Knowledge Space" inspired from ["Querying Complex Networks in Vector Space"](https://github.com/williamleif/graphqembed)

The implementation builds upon and expands the code-base from [Canonical Tensor Decomposition for Knowledge Base Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07297) from  FAIR. For the complete installation of the package please refer to the original [repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/kbc) as the process for installation has not been altered.
